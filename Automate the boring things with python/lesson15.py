#This is a list of 4 that is indexing the first item in the list
spam = ['Dingas', 'Pingas', 'Cap', 'Flexer']
#spam.index('Dingas')
#print(spam[0])
#This print value would be the same as the example
#spam.insert(1, 'Souls')
#This is how you would add/insert a string value
#spam.append('Sammich')
#You can append as many items to a list as you'd like
#spam.remove('Cap')
#This is an example of how to remove items from a list
#Alternatively you can delete an item in the list.
#If you try to remove multiple strings with the same name it'll only remove the first string
#.sort will order them in alphabetical order (You can also reverse the order with .reverse)
#Sorting can no be done with ints and strings
#When sorting items in list capitals will come before regular characters
